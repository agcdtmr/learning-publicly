#TechProject Progress Tuesday ðŸš€ 

I've published an article about setting up a development environment using hashtag#Python and hashtag#dockerizing a hashtag#django application.

In the GitHub repository, I've included the errors I've encountered and how I solved it.

For non-tech professionals, imagine you're building a house. This project is like a comprehensive guide that shows you how to lay the foundation, construct the structure, and add the finishing touches, but instead of a physical house, it's a website. 

We start by setting up a space where you can work comfortably (your development environment), then we create the blueprint for your website (setting up Django). Finally, we package everything neatly so you can easily transport and showcase your website to the world (Dockerizing the application).
