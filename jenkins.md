Today, I successfully implemented a Jenkins Pipeline as a code using a global shared library! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ“Œ What I Did:
âœ… Built a declarative pipeline for better structure and maintainability
âœ… Leveraged shared functions to keep the pipeline clean and reusable
âœ… Explored documentation to understand best practices and hidden gems. Thanks to my colleagues for writing clear hashtag#TechDocumentation!
âœ… Implemented dryRun and testRun modes for safe testing and validation

ðŸ’¡ Lesson learned: Reading documentation is a superpower! The deeper you dive, the more you unlock.

On to the next challenge! ðŸ’»âš¡ hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Automation
