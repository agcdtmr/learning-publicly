🌟 #CareerSwitcher #TechJourney Exciting Update! 🌟

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve been accepted into the inaugural cohort of AI-SEQ Program at QuLearnLabs — focused on AI-Assisted Software Engineering for Quantum Computing and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

Selected from over 500+ applicants worldwide, I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to learn and collaborate with leading minds at the intersection of AI, Quantum Computing and Post-Quantum Cryptography.

As the world rapidly advances toward quantum technologies, gaining hands-on experience in these cutting-edge fields is both a privilege and a responsibility. I’m looking forward to deepening my understanding, contributing meaningfully, and growing with a global cohort of innovators and learners.

Many thanks to the QuLearnLabs team and EIT Deep Tech Talent for this opportunity.

They say quantum particles can exist in multiple states at once — right now, I’m both celebrating 🎉 and gearing up for the May 1st kickoff! 🧠✨
Let the quantum journey begin! 💻🔬🌍
