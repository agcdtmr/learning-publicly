#TechProject Progress Tuesday üöÄ 

I simulated the configuration of a cloud-based environment on #GCP for a data engineering team. 

This involved applying a diverse set of skills encompassing hashtag#cloud computing, virtual machine management, SSH configuration, tool installation, version control, Docker usage, database interaction, and more.

üõ†Ô∏è Here's a snapshot of the progress and key learnings:

1. SSH Key Generation and Setup and Virtual Machine Creation:
 - Generated SSH keys for secure communication
 - Deployed a virtual machine on GCP
 - Established SSH connection to the GCP VM, configured key metadata, and verified the connection

2. Tool Installation on VM:
 - Installed Anaconda, Docker, and Docker Compose for managing multi-container Docker applications

3. SSH Configuration and IDE Integration:
 - Configured SSH for streamlined access to the remote machine
 - Integrated Visual Studio Code with the remote machine using the remote-ssh extension

4. Port Forwarding Configuration:
 - Configured port forwarding in Visual Studio Code to connect to pgAdmin and Jupyter notebooks from the local machine.

5. Uploading Data to PostgreSQL:
 - Run PostgreSQL using pip
 - Run PostgreSQL using anaconda
 - Interacted with PostgreSQL using pgcli and set up a Dockerized PostgreSQL instance.

6. Secure File Transfer:
 - Utilized `sftp` for securely transferring GCP service account credentials to the remote machine.


In the course of working on this project, I've identified key areas where improvements could be implemented for future undertakings. 

Here are the enhancements I believe would contribute to a more efficient and streamlined process:

- Automation:
--- I could consider using tools like Terraform or Google Cloud Deployment Manager to make setting up the cloud infrastructure easier. Making the initial setup process smoother and less prone to mistakes when creating the cloud-based environment on GCP. Instead of manually setting up each part as creating computer components like virtual machines, networks, and storage.
--- I could employ tools like Ansible or Puppet to automate the installation and setup of software on virtual machines. Specifically, the part where I installed Anaconda, Docker, and Docker Compose.
