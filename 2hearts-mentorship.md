ðŸŒŸ Another highlight worth sharing!

ðŸŽ‰ I have been accepted into the hashtag#2hearts Mentorship Program 2024!

Who is 2hearts? It is a community of individuals with immigration backgrounds from the tech scene, including founders, investors, and top executives. Their mission is to empower great talent with immigration backgrounds, enriching hashtag#Europe's tech economy.

"We know the clash of cultures. Weâ€™ve been there."

"We have 2 perspectives in which we see and live the world."

"We sometimes start one step behind, but we end 2 steps ahead."

"We embrace our immigration backgrounds and diversity." 

These words resonated deeply with me, capturing precisely why this community caught my attention back in 2021, when I began my tech learning journey. Finally, a European community that not only acknowledges but celebrates migration stories.

Prior to my move abroad, the concept of mentorship was not prevalent in my social and professional circles. Who needs it when you have your family, relatives, and neighbours as your support system?

That perspective changed upon my arrival to a new country. 

A glimpse to my migration story: From Psychology Degree to clearing tables, cleaning toilets, packing boxes and babysitting to continuously creating opportunities for myself.

(More details for that beautiful story for a next blog post)

Now, with hashtag#2heartsMentorshipProgram, I am thrilled at the prospect of connecting with a mentor who embrace diversity.

Grateful for this incredible opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with fellow participants. And looking forward to the next 6 months of collaboration and personal development. 

Expressing my gratitude to anyone being involved in organising this program. Special thanks to GÃ¼lsah Wilke, Ä°skender Dirik, Oktay Erciyaz & Min-Sung Sean Kim for creating this amazing community in the first place.
