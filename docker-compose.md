#TechProject Progress ðŸš€ 

I've levelled up my knowledge with building Django Application using Docker!

I set up and ran another Django application, but this time, I used Docker Compose. It's like having a fancy toolbox that helps me manage all the different parts of my project.

Another cool thing I did was playing around with Volumes. It's a bit like having magical mirrors that reflect any changes I make to my files, whether I'm working in Visual Studio Code or Docker container. So, everything stays up-to-date without me having to worry about it.

Here's a sneak peek at what's in store:

Started with the basics: setting up a GitHub repository, setup SSH connections, creating a Dockerfile, and configuring Docker Compose. In the process, I "attached" the container workspace to the local system using Volumes. Why is this important? 

One reason is when working on a project, developers often switch between their preferred text editor and Docker environment. If changes made in one environment are not reflected in the other, it can lead to confusion and inefficiency. Keeping everything in sync ensures that developers can seamlessly transition between environments without worrying about discrepancies in code.

For non-tech professionals, the tools I used for this project are like collaborating with highly skilled interior designers who excel in organization. Dockerfile and Docker Compose, just as a designer arranges furniture and decor to create a comfortable and functional space, these tools arrange all the components of your digital environment, ensuring everything is in its place, easily accessible, and ready for your next creative endeavors.
