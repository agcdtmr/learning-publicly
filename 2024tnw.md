If you were at TNW Conference last week, you might have seen me helping attendees find where to scan, print the badge and find ticket's QR code, help navigate the venue or just greeting with a smile. 

That role opened an opportunity to attend different sessions!

Special shoutout to my colleagues Yiran Wang, Artem Golovin, Irene Traverso, Yann Zhang, and Elisa Sassi for making the volunteering even more enjoyable.

I also had great conversations with Rockey William, Sara Ramos, Hannah Froesch, and Benedetta Cervone, and enjoyed catching up with Sven van Hasselt.

Looking forward for next year!
