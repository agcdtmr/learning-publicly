# Is an RDS Cluster “just EC2”?


## What is EC2?
- **EC2** stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud**.  
- It’s basically a **virtual computer** you can rent from AWS.  
- Instead of buying a physical computer, you get a **virtual server** in the cloud that you can use to run programs, store files, host websites, or run databases.  
- You can choose how powerful this virtual computer is — like how much CPU, memory, and storage it has.

## How does EC2 relate to RDS?
- When you use **RDS**, AWS runs the database software for you on these EC2 virtual servers (called **instances**).  
- You don’t have to manage or log into these servers directly — AWS takes care of it.  
- You just use the database — AWS handles the server behind the scenes.

## Analogy
- Think of EC2 as **renting a computer online** that you control.  
- RDS is like **renting a computer with a database pre-installed and managed for you**, so you just focus on using the database without worrying about the computer.
