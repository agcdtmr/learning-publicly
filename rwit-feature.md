Rotterdam Women in Tech featured the blog I wrote about my career change. 🎉

And yes! I got my first job in tech! 🎉 

I'm excited to share that it's now a year of troubleshooting, scrum'ing, bff with bugs and errors, writing documentation, reading code like it is a novel. 👩🏾‍💻

As some of you may know, I come from a background in Psychology and HR. And then I moved abroad so life was a total roller-coaster ride.

However, a few years ago, Benedikt Calleja-Deitmer started (at least tried) teaching me how to code and I won't say I absolutely fell in love with the world of software development and its ability to solve real world problems. But I fell in love with how our brain could think how to solve these real world problems, all I could say that time was "I can be part of this".

I would like to thank my Friends, Family and Mentors, including Leon Noel, Code First Girls, TechLabs Rotterdam, Techgrounds, 2hearts and of course Rotterdam Women in Tech for being a great source of encouragement during this process.

I'm thrilled to be continuing this new chapter and am excited to contribute and grow within this industry. I look forward to connecting with others who share a mutual passion for tech, data, cloud and devops or are looking to transition into tech from a non-tech background. Also because, I just came back from a 2-month Asia vacation my motivation-battery is charged and up for new challenges 🥷 

If you want to find out more about my transition into tech, I’ve been documenting it on my blog 👇
