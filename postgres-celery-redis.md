I just published a new blog post about: "Set Up of a Django Project with PostgreSQL, Celery, Valkey, and RabbitMQ Using VSCode Dev Containers and Docker Compose"

In this blog, I dive into the power of Dev Containers and Docker Compose to streamline Django development, ensuring consistent environments across teams. Whether you're tackling PostgreSQL integration, managing Celery tasks, securing data with Valkey, or leveraging RabbitMQ for messaging, this setup has you covered.

Discover how to enhance productivity with VSCode extensions and simplify your workflow with Docker. If you're a Python developer or part of a team looking to optimize development processes, this blog is a must-read.
